## Overview

This contains the data collected during the course of the second round of HUME annotation. The sub-directories are as follows:

* `uploaded` : The data uploaded to the HUME annotation tool - sources, system outputs and alignments. Also the references.
* `raw-annotation` : The annotations dumped directly from the annotation tool.
* `processed` : The data from the tool, processed into more readable tab-separated value (tsv) files.
