Attached. Please let me know if this information is clear enough.

All in all, there are only 27 HUME tasks that were saved but not submitted out of 3900. I simply excluded these 27.

Please bear in mind that two sentences (i.e., 6 HUME assignments in each language) where deemed as unintelligible by the UCCA annotator, and I removed them from the annotation.


Passages for which there is a "save" (per user):
    498 user_cs_all0.dump
    492 user_cs_all1.dump
    497 user_de_all0.dump
    497 user_de_all1.dump
    287 user_pl_all_3.dump
    288 user_pl_all_4.dump
    529 user_pl_all_5.dump
    317 user_ro_all0.dump: 
    289 user_ro_all1.dump:
    206 user_ro_all2.dump:

Passages for which there is a "submit"  (per user):
    496 user_cs_all0.dump:
    487 user_cs_all1.dump:
    495 user_de_all0.dump:
    496 user_de_all1.dump:
    287 user_pl_all_3.dump

    204 user_ro_all2.dump:


I'm reattaching the dumps. The format is as follows:

1. Each task output is separated by a line of '========='
2. Each task contains (in this order): username, sequence name (should be in 1-1 correspondence with username in our case), index of task in the sequence, passage number (passage numbers should be consistent across the languages, though Polish-English had a different set I bolive), HUME labels (<unit ID>:<label ID>, '#'-delimited), source sentence, translation sentence, alignment, UCCA xml, username of UCCA anntoator, timestamp of submit.

The mapping between index of the task in the sequence and the original files, I added a README file. Relevant part is pasted here:

Original sequences:
German (301 sents in each): first NMT, then PBMT, then SYNTAX
Czech (301 sents in each): first Chimera, then NMT, then Tecto
Romanian (301 sents in each): Combo, NMT, PBMT
Polish (351 sents in each): NMT, PBMT, Year1

From these sequences I derived the sequences for each user:
German, Czech -- two users, both sharing the first 100 sentences and then having distinct 402 (user 0), 401 (user 1) sentences.
Romanian -- 3 users. All have the first 50 in common, then the first has 451 sentences more, and the second and third have 241 and 161 more sentences respectively more.
Polish -- 3 users. All have the first 30 in common, then the first and second have 258 sentences more, and the third has 507 sentences more.


This is the number of tasks assigned to each user

cs_all0 502
cs_all1 501
de_all0 502
de_all1 501

pl_all3 288
pl_all4 288
pl_all5 537

ro_all0 501
ro_all1 291
ro_all2 211
