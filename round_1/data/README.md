## Overview

This contains the data collected during the course of the first round of HUME annotation. The sub-directories are as follows:

* `uploaded` : The system outputs uploaded to the annotation tool, as well the sources, reference and  bleu scores. The source and references
are taken from the [HimL 2015 Test Sets](http://www.himl.eu/test-sets) 
* `raw-annotation` : The annotations dumped directly from the annotation tool.
* `processed` : The data from the tool, processed into more readable comma-separated value (csv) files.
* `direct-assessment` : The data gathered from direct assessment of the translation (i.e. adequacy judgements)
